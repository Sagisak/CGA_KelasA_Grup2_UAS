# Ant Tower Defense

This is a group project assignment from one of our courses, *Computer Graphics Animation*, at our university. We were tasked with creating an interactive project to enhance our understanding of computer graphics, vertices, procedural generation, the Unity engine, and much more. Ultimately, the idea chosen for our project was to create a tower defense game.  

## Features  

- **Auto-Generated Maps**: Each gameplay session features a unique map, requiring players to adapt their strategies as ants find new paths to reach their goals.  
- **Three Unique Towers**: Each tower has distinct attributes and purposes.  
- **Endless Survival Mode**: Test your skills by surviving as long as possible in this endless gameplay mode.  
- **Progressive Difficulty**: The game becomes increasingly challenging with each round, as ants multiply in number and become tougher.  

## How to Play  

1. **Place Towers**: Choose from a variety of towers to place on the map. Towers can only be placed on darker terrains. Select towers from the options provided.  
2. **Defend the Colony**: Stop enemies from reaching the other side of the map.  
3. **Earn Rewards**: Earn 5 coins for each ant you kill.  
4. **Survive**: Challenge yourself to last as long as possible.  

## Controls  

- **W/Up Arrow**: Move the camera north on the map.  
- **S/Down Arrow**: Move the camera south on the map.  
- **Left Mouse Button**: Place a tower on a designated area or select a tower from the options.  
- **Right Mouse Button**: Cancel a tower placement before it is set on the map.  

## Notes  

- **Unity Version**: We used Unity version 2022.3.8f1. If you use a newer version, you might see prompts indicating that the files are outdated. You can safely ignore these and proceed, as the game is compatible with other Unity versions, though we recommend using 2022.3.8f1 for the best experience.  
- **Error Prompt**: When opening the project, you may encounter an error prompt about updates. This is related to one of the dependencies we used (A* Pathfinding Project), where a file attempts to connect to the internet using an outdated and insecure connection. Unity blocks this attempt, but it does not impact the functionality of the game.
