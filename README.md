# Ant Tower Defense

This is a group project assignment from one of our courses, called Computer Graphic Animation, in our university. We are assign to create an interactive project to enhance our understanding of computer graphics, vertices, procedurals, unity engine, and so much more. In the end, the idea chosen for our project is to make a tower defense game.

## Features

- Maps are auto-generated, so each gameplay has a different map and different strategy that you need to create as the ant find new path to reach their goal.
- There are three towers, each with their different set of attributes with their own purposes.
- Survive as long as you can as the game has no end at all.
- For each round, the game becomes progressively difficult with the ant multiply in quantities and tougher as they go.

## How to Play

1. **Place Towers**: Choose from a variety of towers to place on the map accordance with your economy situation 
2. **Defend the Colony**: Stop enemies from reaching to the other side
3. **Earn Rewards**: Each ant you kill earns you 5 coins.
4. **Progress**: Challenge yourself by surviving as lost as possible.

## Note
- The unity version we use is the 2022.3.8f1 version. If you use some newer version of unity, you might see some prompt asking that the files are outdated. Simply ignore it and proceed as the game can be play in any version but we recommend using 2022.3.8f1.
- When opening the folders and files in unity, you will see an error prompt talking about updates. Do not worry as that is just a minor error that doesn't contribute to the project as it is one of the dependecies we use to create the game A* project where one of the files is trying a newer version of the game and try to make a connection to the internet. However, unity has disclose stating this is a insecure connection not allowed. Nontheless, it doesnt bother with the project at all.
